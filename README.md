# Create Simli App (OpenAI)
This starter is an example of how to create a composable Simli interaction that runs in a Next.js app.

 ## Usage
 1. Rename .env_sample to .env and paste your API keys: [SIMLI-API-KEY](https://www.simli.com/profile) and [OPENAI-API-KEY](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile?tab=api-keys) <br/> If you want to try Simli but don't have API access to these third parties, ask in Discord and we can help you out with that ([Discord Link](https://discord.gg/yQx49zNF4d)). 
```js
NEXT_PUBLIC_SIMLI_API_KEY="SIMLI-API-KEY"
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY="OPENAI-API-KEY"
``` 

2. Insall packages
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Customize your avatar's face and prompt by editing app/page.tsx.
```js
const avatar = {
  name: "Frank",
  simli_faceid: "5514e24d-6086-46a3-ace4-6a7264e5cb7c",
  initialPrompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant named Frank. You are friendly and concise in your responses. Your task is to help users with any questions they might have.",
};
```

## Characters
You can swap out the character by finding one that you like in the [docs](https://docs.simli.com/introduction), or [create your own](https://app.simli.com/)
